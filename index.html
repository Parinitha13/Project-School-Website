                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> East Brunsiwck Board of Education aimed to reconfigue grade levels of the East Brunswick Public Schools and add additonal classrooms to the temporarily existing 30 classrooms of Churchill Junior High School. Initially, the eight elementary schools of the East Brunswick District housed students from grades K-4, Hammarskjold Middle School housed grades 5-6, and Churchill Junior High School housed students from grades 7-9, and East Brunswick High School housed students from grades 10-12. The reconfiguration measure was implemented and the changes were that Elementary Schools in the East Brunsiwck district housed students in grade levels K-5, Hammarskjold Middle School has grades 6-7, Churchill accomodated rades 8-9, and East Brunswick High School continues to house students from grades 10-12. The renovation of the number of classrooms in Churchill Junior High School of 32 temporary classrooms were identical to exiting junior high school classrooms in terms of furnishing, technology, and climate management.

                        The plan was in response to a projected increase in the number of students over the next three years. The idea had three distinct priorities- beneficial in developing a sustainable elementary capacity in all elementary schools of the East Brunswick District and focuses on equity across elementary schools to maintain costs and minimize tax impacts on the residents of the East Brunswick Community. </p>

Students will conduct several laboratory experiments in their science classes. There are two levels, 8th Grade Academic Science and 8th Grade Honors Science. The 9th grade Science Curriculum offers three levels of biology that consists of topics like structure and function of matter and organisms, inheritance and variation of traits, natural selection and evolution, and human impact on populations and communities. The three levels of 9th Grade Biology are Biology Honors, Biology Accelerated, and Biology. Extra-curricular activities and Science Clubs include The Science Olympiad and Science League. The Science Olympiad team competes in a regional competition in January, then top teams advance to the state competition in March. Students try out for a position on the team during the first marking period of the school year, and meetings are held twice each week. Advisors to the CJHS team are William Jasko and Rebecca Cobb. Students participating in Science League take a monthly biology test at EBHS after school from January-April. Students try out for a position on the team during the first semester, and weekly meetings are held. The advisor to the team is Maria Gorman. </p>
